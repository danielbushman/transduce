# transform-json

Transforms JSON from one schema to another. Such a simple thing that needs to be done all the time, and yet I haven't seen a solution I like. The overriding design goal is an elegant template syntax. Most of the time spent using the library will be in the templates. They should be natural to read and quick to use. The template should look like what it will generate.

# Setup

`npm i -g mocha`
`npm i`

# Usage

use babel: `gulp`
run tests: `npm test`


# TODO

- [ ] rename folder and in package.json
- [ ] use lodash-fp in place of Ramda

## Scratchpad

curry up: findPath = path(path); findPath(json)
